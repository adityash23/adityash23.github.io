This is an example post with some text. I think it's important to smoothen out the blog writing process so I don't spend a lot of time before/after writing up a post. It should be seamless - as smooth as clicking Publish on WordPress or Wix.

Currently waiting for Docker to get up running.

Another test - does writing a new post automatically display it on the blog page?
