# Courses I've Taken at McGill University

## Algorithms & Theory

### **COMP 252: Honours Algorithms and Data Structures**  
Honours level course on design and analysis of data structures and algorithms, taught by [Luc Devroye](https://luc.devroye.org). Focus on priving the correctness of algorithms and determining their computational complexity. 

### **COMP 250: Introduction to Algorithms**  
A foundational course in algorithms and data structures, covering topics like sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

### **COMP 302: Programming Languages and Paradigms**
