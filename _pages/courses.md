## Courses I've taken at McGill University

### Algorithms & Theory

#### **COMP 252: Honours Algorithms and Data Structures**  
Honours level course on design and analysis of algorithms and data structures, taught by [Luc Devroye](https://luc.devroye.org). Focus on proving algorithm correctness and analyzing computational complexity. Topics included sorting, graph algorithms, flow networks, dynamic programming, and asymptotic analysis.

#### **COMP 302: Programming Languages and Paradigms**  
Course on functional and logic programming using OCaml, taught by [Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/index.html). Programming language design issues and programming paradigms. Binding and scoping, parameter passing, lambda abstraction, data abstraction, type checking.

### Systems & Programming

#### **COMP 310: Operating Systems**  
A study of the design and implementation of modern operating systems, focusing on memory management and process synchronization. Implemented demand paging, job scheduling and shell commands in a mini-OS developed throughout the course. 

#### **COMP 273: Introduction to Computer Systems**  
Learnt about combinational and sequential digital circuits, MIPS Assembly, cache, virtual memory and pipelining. Created a mini CPU with 4 bit instructions as part of the final project.
